# The Path to Human Flourishing and Unconditional Happiness

Start here

- ## For the tech savvy
  - ### Why:
    Here's a list of statements, see if all of them are true about you:

     - Would you say you are happy irrespective of external conditions? 
     - Patient and tranquil when in a heated debate with your boss about a product feature? 
     - Never angry even when your colleague interrupts your flow state or when you need to pull another all-nighter? 
     - Never frustrated and wasting mental energy when you can't debug that pesky bug? 
     - Never anxious when your project deadline is inching closer and you are running late? 
     - Never depressed nor have existential dread about life and death?
     - Have found satisfaction and meaning, and don't try to find in external things like a job promotion or a penthouse?

      If so, congrats! You have reached the aim of most philosophers over the last 3000 years. Probably should start helping others :)

      If not, this article explains about 'human flourishing', the permanent state where all of the above things become true. And also, how to get there.

      Why care about human flourishing?
      As I said, many philosophers have claimed it is the highest goal/achievement of one's life. Let's see why:

      a) All beings want to be happy and not suffer.
      Consider why you do the things you do. What the ultimate drive for any of your goals, plans, actions is. Why most human beings have a career, raise a family, have hobbies, and have a drive for self-improvement or self-actualization. If you think about it enough youâ€™d probably reach the ultimate answer: contentment, happiness, tranquility, or what the ancient Greeks called Eudaemonia (human flourishing). Whether such happiness is for you or your fellow living beings, the end goal is the same. 

      b) Flourishing human = a good human
      A flourishing human also has virtues like compassion, love, kindness, wisdom and self-restraint. Such a person is the very definition of a good & ethical person, and we sure do need more of such people to make the world a better and safer place. Most of the man-made global issues today like war, genocide, greed, enivronmental collapse would be fixed if people were more compassionate and satisfied with little.
